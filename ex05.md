Exercise 05 - Advanced Reading List
================================

Today we're creating a reading list - in JAVASCRIPT. 
First, let's talk objects! 

We've seen objects and methods before - and Javascript has those too. However, they look different, and behave slightly different. We don't have inheritance the same way, and we don't define methods, or initialization the same way. There's lots of stuff that's different, mostly because it's a bit simpler to work with. We're just going to be using the equivalent of dictionaries that contain functions, and functions that can have properties. Let's get started.  
  

The first thing we're going to be dealing with is the Book List itself. Book lists are complex, and need to be "set up" before they can be used. Normally, we'd declare an `__init__()` function on an object, and that would get run whenever we set up a new copy of the object.

We don't have any of that fancy shit in Javascript, we just have Objects, and those Objects can have Properties. Properties can be anything, including Functions. Functions are Objects too, so they can have their own Properties. Just like God intended.

So, when you think of an object in Javascript, think of this:
```javascript
var myHouse = {
	roommates: ['Janardan', 'KF', 'Rebecca', 'Elli', 'Meeko'],
	sqFootage: 1400,
	rent: "Too Damn Much"
}
```
Which is basically:
```javascript
{
	property: value,
	property: value,
	property: value
}
```

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.  
So, what about setting things up whenever you create a thing? After all, the objects above can't be copied easily, and we can't think of them as Classes very easily, can we? 

Let's think. What /is/ a class? It's just a template for an object - all cats have fur, but what color is it? All starfleet ships have a designation, but it differs from ship to ship. Objects instances of some class, but Javascript doesn't /have/ classes, does it?  

Javascript might not really have classes, but as we've probably mentioned, it's very permissive. We can abuse technicalities to make it do what we want, and it will oblige well enough.  

In Javascript functions, we get a special variable called `this`. It refers to the "calling context", which I'll explain in a minute. Let's get our hands dirty with this:

```javascript
var StarShip = function(designation, registryNumber, crewComplement){
	this.designation = designation || "Unknown Designation";
	this.registryNumber = registryNumber || "registryNumber";
	this.crewComplement = crewComplement || 0;
}
```
Which is basically just:

```javascript
var ClassName = function(property, property){
	this.property = property || defaultValue;
	this.property = property || defaultValue;
}
```
As an aside, that `property || defaultValue;` syntax is a way to set default values. It has to do with lazy evaluation - the second part never runs if the first part has some kind of value set.

So, how do we use this? We can create a few starships like this:
```javascript
var enterprise = new StarShip("Enterprise", "NCC-1701-D", 1014);

var birdOfPrey = new StarShip("IKS Koraga", "K'Vort", "25")

```

Whenever we use the "new" keyword, this is a shortcut. What happens underneath is essentially the function returns /itself/, but as an object. Go ahead and console.log our ships, and see what's happened.  

Doing it like this is called using the **constructor invocation pattern**, basically using JS in an object-oriented way.


Time for the exercise:  


Create a class for your booklist through the constructor invocation pattern. `BookList = function() {}`
- BookLists should have the following properties:
	- Number of books marked as read (eg, BookList.booksRead)
	- Number of books marked not read yet
	- An array of all the Books (eg. BookList.bookShelf - is an array.)
- Booklists should have methods that can do or return the following things:
	- A pointer to the next book to read (a book object)(eg, BookList.nextBook() - returns a Book)
	- Current book being read (book object)
	- Last book read(book object)
	- add(book) - should add a book to the books list.
	- finishCurrentBook - should find the current book you're reading, mark it as read, give it a "read" date (of right now) and then change the next book in the queue to be the current book. It should also change the "next book" pointer to a random book that hasn't been read yet.
Create another class called Book. Book = function() {}
- Each book should have several properties:
	- Title
	- Genre
	- Author
	- Read (true or false)
	- Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a JS Date() object
- Every Booklist should have a few methods:


Booklists and Books might need more methods than that. Feel free to experiment with making your book list more useful or interesting.
