The Reading List
================

Ah, reading. So hard to keep track of what you want to read, and what you've already read. For instance, I'm sure you're aware that the Star Wars Extended Universe novels are quite voluminous, and there's a lot of them. How am I supposed to keep track of what timelines I've covered, and what miniseries I've yet to get to? 

I'm sure everyone is familiar with this problem, so let's make a reading list! First, pick your favorite science-fiction series, with bonus points if it's got multiple miniseries If you can't possibly pick a favorite, I suggest you go with a classic, Frank Herbert's Dune.

What we're going to do is load all of the books in a series into a reading list, and then we're going to write some functions that can give us information, and keep which books we've read straight. 

Put some books as objects in an array, like this :
