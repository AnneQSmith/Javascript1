Exercise 4 - Your Command-Line Pal That's Fun To Be With
========================================================

Pets are great and hilarious, as evidenced by youtube. But, they're also messy, leave a lot of hair around, and meow at you in the middle of the night even though you've let him into and out of the room like 20 times already.  

Screw that, let's make our own pet that doesn't do anything until we tell it to, and is obligated to love us forever.  

- Create an object that represents a cat. It should have properties for tiredness, hunger, loneliness and happiness
	- Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties (there's an example in the slides). Call them something that actually represents what would increase or decrease these things, like "feed", "sleep", or "pet".
	- Last, write a method that prints out the cat's status in each area.
	- Bonus: Make the functions take arguments that increase or decrease arbitrary amounts
	- Bonus: Make the functions as arbitrary as cats are - make it so the cat sometimes doesn't want to be petted.
