Exercise 01 - Translation
=========================


You'll need to take a look at the files in the Javascript-to-Python folder. Use the files inside to translate this program from Python to Javascript.

You might recognize this from (Project Euler Exercise 1)[http://projecteuler.net/problem=1] - that's because that's what it is. 

If you haven't done it yet, don't look at the answers below.

```python
## Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

sum = 0
for i in range(0,1001):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        sum += i
print sum

```
