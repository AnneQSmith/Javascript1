Exercise 01 - Translation
=========================

Congratulations on your new job at the United Programming Languages Association! Your first post is Translator. Relations between Javascript and Python have been testy of late, so we're going to perform some delicate diplomacy. This will challenge your knowledge of both Python and Javascript, but be sure to respect the various accents and cultural norms, or you'll offend the compilers. This could result in war between our peoples, so be sure to take a look at your python-to-javascript dictionary. 



You might recognize this from [Project Euler Exercise 1](http://projecteuler.net/problem=1) - that's because that's what it is. We feel like this will be a good starter assignment - but watch out for those curly braces.

Here's our first bit of code from the Python delegation - make sure the Javascriptians understand it well.

```python
## Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

sum = 0
for i in range(0,1001):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        sum += i
print sum

```
