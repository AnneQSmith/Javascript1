Exercise 02 - Translation
=========================

Another translation exercise brought to you by the letter Î£ and the number 0.5772156649

Translate this implementation to Javascript from Python. Feel free to try to make it run better.

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```python

## Return a list of fibonacci numbers that go up to but not beyond the maximum number provided
def fibonacci_set(max):
	if max > 1:
		fib_list = [1]
		current_fib = 1
		while current_fib < max:
			fib_list.append(current_fib)
			current_fib += fib_list[-1]

		return fib_list
	else:
		return [1, 1]

## Tell me if a number is even
def even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

print sum(filter(even,fibonacci_set(4000000)))

```
